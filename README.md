- /Example_Project/: This folder contains a set of files provided to students
  as an example of what a project submission should look like. While there is
  no review associated with this submission, it can still be used as a
  reference for the kind of output that students should produce with their own
  submissions.

- /Example_2/: This folder contains a set of files reflecting an example
  project submission, with an evaluation in .pdf format. This reflects a
  submission that succeeds on many points, but ultimately fails on some rubric
  points that require revision.

- /Project_Template/: This folder contains a set of files provided to students
  to help them organize and get started with their project.
